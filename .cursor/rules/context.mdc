# FFmpeg Tools Project

This repo is a collection of high-level scripts to interact with ffmpeg in an easier way. It's split into various categories: audio, video, and image processing. Each directory contains specialized scripts for different ffmpeg operations.

## Project Structure
- `video/`: Scripts for video processing
- `audio/`: Scripts for audio processing 
- `image/`: Scripts for image processing

## Guidelines
- Each script should focus on a single FFmpeg operation/task
- Begin scripts with clear header comments explaining purpose and usage
- Include proper error handling with helpful messages
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Create appropriate output directories as needed
- Display helpful progress information and results
- Update the README.md whenever new functionality is added
